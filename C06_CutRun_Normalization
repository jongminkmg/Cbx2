## * Normalization rationale:
## 1) Not use normalizing to the 'spike-in'. This assumes I have the same cell numbers across comparing samples. 
##    However, using the exact same cell numbers across samples is not easy when I work with small cell numbers, especially after sorting. 
## 2) Total read number normalization is not sufficient, if signal-to-noise is different between different samples. 
##    e.g.) even with the same starting material, if exp A 'worked better' than exp B, then exp A will show many artificial 'stronger' peaks.
## 3) Peak composition differences need to be accounted for.
##    e.g.) Let's assume promoter A accounts for 50% of all reads. If promoter A binding is gone, that will inflate up all the other promoter signal with total read norm.
##
##* What will I do?
## 1) Obtain promoter signal of all genes
## 2) Obtain scaling factors by EdgeR's TMM normalization 
## 3) Divide with the 'scaling factors'
##
## * Remember, this assumes
## 1) intensity distribution at promoters across different conditions is the same
## 2) What I am measuring is how the enrichment of my factor X across promoters is relatively distributed differently in all promoters.
##    Thus, it cannot measure a 'global' increase or decrease in intensity.

# Remove genes with zero counts for all samples
dgeFull <- DGEList(dgeFull$counts[apply(dgeFull$counts, 1, sum)!=0, ], group=dgeFull$samples$group)
# (e.g. 24984 elements to 21404 elements)

# Estimate normalization factor 
# (Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM): 
# assuming the majority of 'housekeeping' genes have the same expression levels across conditions)
dgeFull <- calcNormFactors(dgeFull, method="TMM")

# Apply obtained library size and normalization factor values to the original counts
# TMM counts are:
# Count / (library size * normalization factor)
